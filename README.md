## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am Raunak, a PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ in the [Weitz group](https://weitzgroup.umd.edu). My research is highly interdisciplinary, covering the broad areas of Physics and Deep Learning based-inverse modeling for dynamical systems. Broadly, I have worked on problems in virus-microbe networks, stochastic trajectories of Brownian particles, SNR optimization for feedback-control measurements using the tools of dynamical systems and deep learning. 

- ğŸ“« Please feel free to reach me out at rdey-at-umd-dot-edu with questions and comments. 
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Latent space modeling for dynamical systems.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Bayesian inference for dynamical systems.  
- âš¡ Fun fact: 'stressed' spelled backwards is 'desserts' ğŸ˜„
- ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ Now I live in the US, but I come from the beautiful city of Kolkata in India.
