## Hi there 👋

I am Raunak, a PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park 🇺🇸 in the [Weitz group](https://weitzgroup.umd.edu). My research is highly interdisciplinary, covering the broad areas of Physics and Deep Learning based-inverse modeling for dynamical systems. Broadly, I have worked on problems in virus-microbe networks, stochastic trajectories of Brownian particles, SNR optimization for feedback-control measurements using the tools of dynamical systems and deep learning. 

- 📫 Please feel free to reach me out at rdey-at-umd-dot-edu with questions and comments. 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Latent space modeling for dynamical systems.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Bayesian inference for dynamical systems.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: 'stressed' spelled backwards is 'desserts' 😄
- 🇮🇳 Now I live in the US, but I come from the beautiful city of Kolkata in India.
